                                Nintendo was very much a large part of my childhood, I loved to play games with my brothers and sisters, my first favourite was Super Mario World and then later
                                when the Game Boy was released, Pokemon became an instant favourite, so expect to see plenty of pokemon titles pop up on these pages!
