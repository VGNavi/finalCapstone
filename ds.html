                        The DS was a dual screen portable console with touch screen technology, there
                        were a few in this series, the first was released 2004, the lite was released
                        2006, which as the name suggests, was a lighter version of the bulky DS.
                        The DSi followed in 2008 featuring a camera, and an XL version for those who 
                        preferred a larger screen.
                        Finally the 3DS was released in 2011, with an XL version in 2015.
                        <br><br>
                        The first DS I had was the original DS console, it was a white version with 
                        the classic release of Nintendogs, a game where you had your own virtual pet 
                        dog, and using the styus, you could interact with it. 
                        The built in microphone enabled you to whistle to get your dogs attention, 
                        it was great fun for its time.

                <p class="review-text">
                    This is a relaxing game where you play as a 
                    character living in a town with animal characters
                    for neighbours, the Animal Crossing games are synced
                    to the systems clock, so what day and time you play
                    really changes the experience.
                    <br><br>
                    My love for animal crossing started with the
                    original GameCube version, but a portable console   
                    with wireless capabilities really made this game 
                    more enjoyable, the touch screen was super fun, 
                    making selection more accurate, and sorting storage
                    that little bit easier than a regular game.

                <h4>Harvest Moon:<br>DS</h4>
                <img class="review-img" src="img/Harvest_Moon_DS_Coverart.png" alt="'Harvest Moon: DS' Box Art">
                <p class="review-text">
                    Harvest Moon is considered to be another relaxing
                    game, it is from the Story of Seasons series before
                    they rebranded and another company held the 'Harvest
                    Moon' name and made similar games.
                    it is a farm simlation & role playing game, you
                    can farm crops and raise livestock, you can upgrade
                    your home and build friendships.
                    <br><br>
                    I really enjoyed this game in particular from this 
                    series, as you could have your horse hold your crops
                    before you store or ship them to sell, which made 
                    harvesting a lot less tedious, running back and forth
                    to empty your characters backpack storage.

                <p class="review-text">
                    This is a super enjoyable game from The Legend
                    of Zelda series, where you can explore islands
                    by sailing between them, and explore the dungeons 
                    on foot. On the top screen of the console you can 
                    view a map, you can also make notes on the map 
                    by bringing it down to the bottom screen and 
                    drawing on it.
                    <br><br>
                    This game featured a large dungeon in which 
                    Link needs to obtain sea charts to allow him 
                    to sail other parts of the ocean, these dungeons 
                    have phantoms, an enemy in which you use stealth 
                    to get past, rather than engage in combat.

                <p class="review-text">
                    A great game from the Pokemon series. This game
                    is located in the 'Sinnoh' region, the same as 
                    Diamond & Pearl, but the wireless features had 
                    been enhanced.
                    <br><br>
                    Every Gen IV Pokemon (apart from legendaries)
                    were included in Platinum, meaning there were
                    no version exclusives, so you could enjoy all
                    of the new mons. I was a little underwhelmed 
                    with the fire type starter Pokemon 'Chimchar'
                    and opted in for Piplup, Empoleon makes for a
                    very well designed Pokemon! I think I enjoyed 
                    the Pokemon Super Contests more than anything 
                    in this generation.
