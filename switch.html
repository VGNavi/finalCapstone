                        The Switch is Nintendos current console, it was released in 2017 with the lite 
						version released in 2019. It is a portable handheld console that also comes with 
						a dock which enabled you to attatch it to the tv and play there also, it has 
						removeable controllers (joy-cons) which you can get in many different colours for 
						customisation.
                        <br><br>
						This console has an excellent collection of games, with quite a few remasters and 
						ports, the online membership allows you to play some classics from the NES, SNES, 
						N64 and even the Sega Genesis. My most played gaame was Animal Crossing: New Horizons,
						which took the world by storm during the Covid 19 lockdown, enabling people to interact 
						in the gaming world.

					After hearing about this game pre-release, I had
					high hopes, and I was not dissapointed! this was a 
					fantastic addition to the Pokemon series, a whole
					new way of capturing pokemon, and I felt it gave me
					a real drive to finish the PokeDex this time.
					<br><br>
					I was most looking forward to exploring the open-world 
					and I loved every second, unlocking different ways to 
					get around after each 'boss' battle kept me engaged with
					the storyline, being able to see shiny pokemon made it 
					super fun to shiny hunt! I can only hope this won't be 
					the only 'Legends' game.

					As far as relaxing games go, this wins, it is so
					laid back and allows you to go at your own pace
					completely, theres plenty to do when you first 
					begin, and so much stuff to collect to decorate 
					your home and your whole island with.
					<br><br>
					When I heard the news of this games release, I 
					was over the moon, with todays consoles capabilities
					for online play, I was thinking of all the 
					possibilities, I wanted everyone I knew to play 
					this with me! To see that you could decorate your 
					whole island, not just your house, and on top of that
					completely shape the land, made me so excited to get 
					stuck in!

					This game, as the title suggest, is a dungeon 
					crawler, with hack and slash combat. You go 
					into the dungeons, filled with all types of 
					mobs and get past traps and puzzles, then a 
					final boss to get out alive with your loot.
					<br><br>
					As you progress you unlock new areas and 
					difficulties, there is tons of DLC content 
					for very good prices, and this is super fun 
					to play with friends, I never thought I would 
					enjoy this game when my partner suggested I 
					play with him, but I quickly got into it!

					I was looking forward to this game for some time 
					after 'Pokemon Legends: Arceus' was released, 
					knowing they were keeping the open-world but 
					keeping everything else from the main game series.
					<br><br> 
					I did have a big problem with the quality of this 
					game in regards to the fps, it just felt very poor 
					and unfinished coming from such a huge name. But I 
					have to admit, regardless of the issues, I really 
					enjoyed this game and the story, there was a lot of
					content and so much exploring to do. I hope the next 
					game is way more polished when it is released.
