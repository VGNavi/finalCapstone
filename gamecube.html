                        The GameCube was released in 2001, it was Nintendos first console that used optical 
                        discs instead of ROM cartridges. The GameCube competed with Sony's PlayStation 2 and
                        Microsoft's Xbox. GameCube did come close third to Xbox. During this consoles lifespan 
                        of 6 years, Nintendo released over 600 games!
                        <br><br>
						This console had so many great games that I could not narrow it down to just one 
                        specific series, Mario Party were incredible multi-player games, Animal Crossing 
                        was super fun if members of your household also played, since you shared a village, 
                        Pikmin was a new and exciting strategy game with super cute characters.

                    a lot of time, but gave me fond memories!

                <p class="review-text">
                    Luigis Mansion was a launch title for GameCube,
                    and is the second game where you play as Luigi 
                    for the main character, not Mario. 
                    This game was very eerie, and whilst frightening
                    me, I thouroughly enjoyed how challenging it was!
                    <br><br>
                    You start in a Mansion with locked doors, and 
                    defeat ghosts that pop up and scare you by stunning
                    them with your flash light and using the Poltergust
                    3000 to vaccum them, there were boss fights where 
                    you would get keys to access other parts of the Mansion,
                    to eventually try and find missing Mario.

                    An amazing game from the Super Mario series, I 
                    really loved playing this title, the art work and 
                    gameplay was so different to the other Mario games,
                    the Story was interesting, making it that much more
                    enjoyable to play!
                    <br><br> 
                    The battle system was the same as the original
                    Paper Mario, and I really wish they had kept 
                    it for future titles, each move you could make 
                    more powerful with extra action commands, you 
                    could dodge incoming hits from enemies, reducing
                    and sometimes completely negating damage.

                    Before the release of Breath of the Wild for 
                    the Switch, this was my favourite game from The 
                    Legend of Zelda series, there's a bunch of puzzles,
                    lots of exploring with 9 large areas, and a new 
                    guide mysterious guide 'Midna'. 
                    <br><br>
                    I particularly liked this game because you could 
                    play as a wolf due to part of this games storyline,
                    the 'darkness' of this game really drew me in, it 
                    had a lot of bright and wonderful features also, I 
                    liked fishing and seeing the village cat.

                <p class="review-text">
                    This Pokemon game had a totally different feel 
                    to it than the previous main games, the 3D world 
                    felt very exciting, you did not encounter wild 
                    pokemon in this game, instead you would 'snag' 
                    them from other trainers.
                    <br><br> 
                    There was a lot of double battles in this game 
                    and with it having a different storyline
                    to the previous games was really refreshing and 
                    starting with both Umbreon and Espeon felt like 
                    such a treat! This game made me warm to the new generation
                    of Pokemon.
